Short Biography
======
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/fujimountain.jpg" alt="MoXiangyu" style="float:right; width:260px; margin:0 0 10px 15px;" />
I am a student in the **Mingyue Innovation Class** at **Chongqing University**, majoring in **Robotics Engineering**. My training follows a **project-driven and interdisciplinary engineering framework**, integrating **control theory, embedded systems, power electronics, sensing, and computer vision** into complete robotic and aerial systems.

My primary research and engineering interests focus on **flight control systems, embedded hardware design, and system-level integration** for unmanned platforms. I have designed and implemented **custom electrical control units**, **CAN-based communication networks**, and **vision-guided flight control pipelines**, enabling reliable coordination between **flight controllers, propulsion units, sensors, and actuators** in UAV systems.

I have extensive experience in **open-source flight controller secondary development (PX4-based)**, including **control logic modification, middleware communication, and hardware-software co-debugging**. My work also includes **flight dynamics modeling and simulation**, which I use to validate control strategies before deployment on real hardware.

Through national-level robotics and electronic design competitions and research projects, I have developed strong capabilities in **engineering verification, system debugging, and reliability-oriented design**. My work emphasizes **transforming theoretical models into stable, deployable, and field-tested autonomous systems**, particularly for **UAVs and robotic platforms operating under strict power, timing, and safety constraints**.
