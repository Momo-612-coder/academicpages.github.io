## Abstract

## 1. Personalized Practice & Track Choice
- Selected **technical track** in UAV engineering based on **system-level thinking** and **engineering-oriented problem solving**
- Integrated technical learning with **innovation & entrepreneurship projects**, balancing **system reliability** and **design thinking**
- Practiced **macro-level problem framing** to ensure solutions align with **real-world application needs**

## 2. UAV Technology Lab
### 2.1 FT580 Tandem-Rotor UAV
- Contributed to **full-system design**: airframe, propulsion, avionics, and flight control integration
- Focused on **system reliability, high-lift efficiency, and engineering feasibility**
- Developed awareness of **subsystem interdependencies** and **long-term maintainability**

### 2.2 Flight Control & Electrical Systems
- Designed **PX4–DroneCAN communication architecture** for multi-node real-time data exchange
- Conducted **hardware/software integration**, including **CAN signal testing**, **data organization**, and **latency/packet loss validation**
- Built **redundant, safe, and robust electrical control system**: power distribution, engine control, cooling, servos, sensors
- Implemented **multi-layer software architecture** (BSP, modules, APP, scheduler) with **message-driven decoupling**
- Developed **high-current power/current monitor** for system feedback, closed-loop control, and real-time safety protection
- Conducted iterative **hardware/software optimization**, improving **robustness, reliability, and system-level awareness**

## 3. Entrepreneurship & Innovation Projects
### 3.1 AI Pet Companion Project

- Designed and implemented **embedded hardware & control system** for **biomimetic motion and emotion mapping**
- Developed **motion algorithms** for smooth servo-driven actions and **user-centric feedback validation**

### 3.2 Vision-Guided High-Speed Flight System
- Led **payload UAV with visual guidance**, integrating **IMU & vision fusion**, **load-adaptive flight control**, and **launch platform coordination**
- Managed **team tasks, project schedule, and system optimization**
- Delivered **engineering-grade system** with **structural optimization, control surface tuning, and algorithm refinement**

## 4. Competitions
- **National University Electronic Design Contest – 2nd Prize**
- Implemented **gimbal control, system modeling, and chassis–vision coordination**
- Demonstrated **system-level engineering thinking** and **end-to-end integration capability**

## 5. Summary
- Developed strong skills in **system-level UAV design, embedded communication, power electronics, and control**
- Gained experience in **hardware-software co-design, iterative prototyping, and engineering validation**
- Combined **technical depth** with **real-world application awareness** and **team-based project execution**
