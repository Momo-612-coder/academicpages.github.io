## Abstract
## Extracurricular Engineering Profile (2024–2025)

### RoboMaster UAV System (Vice Captain → UAV Lead)
- Led a **competition-grade UAV platform** integrating **gimbal control, vision targeting, power systems, and communication**
- Developed a **custom real-time task scheduler** and **dual-loop (angle + rate) gimbal control** with feed-forward compensation
- Achieved **match-level stability and accuracy**, enabling **20 s outpost strike** and **5 m palm-sized projectile dispersion**

### Embedded Control & System Software
- Built **full UAV control firmware** (non-framework) including:
  - Gimbal control
  - Vision interface
  - Referee system communication
  - Operator UI link
- Implemented **PX4-based secondary development** and hardware–software co-debugging
- Performed **flight dynamics modeling and simulation** to validate control strategies

### Power Electronics & Hardware Design
- Designed a **48 V parallel power system** (4 channels, ≥200 W each) with:
  - **Active reverse-current protection**
  - **<30 mV conduction drop**
  - **30–50 A current capability**
- Completed **two PCB iterations**, validated with **300 W continuous-load testing**
- Integrated power system into **mechanically constrained UAV airframe**

### Motor Control & Actuation
- Designed and tested:
  - **FOC motor driver PCB**
  - **High-speed magnetic encoder**
  - **Closed-loop BLDC control firmware**
- Achieved **encoder-based closed-loop gimbal and wheel motor control**

### Vision-Guided Flight System (National Innovation Project Lead)
- Architected a **stacked flight-control module** (vision + MCU + power, 2.5 × 3 × 5.5 cm)
- Implemented **vision-based guidance pipeline**:
  - Target detection
  - Kalman filtering
  - Coordinate transformation
  - Dual-loop PID + airspeed feed-forward
- Demonstrated **rapid self-stabilization** and **closed-loop target tracking** in prototype tests

### Engineering Leadership & Integration
- Coordinated **mechanical, electrical, and vision teams** as UAV product lead
- Managed **iteration cycles, testing, and acceptance checks**
- Established **cross-disciplinary integration workflow** from simulation → PCB → firmware → field testing
